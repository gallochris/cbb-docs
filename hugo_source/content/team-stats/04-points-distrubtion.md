How a team gets its points can be broken down into 3 areas:

1. Free throws: total points on made free throws
2. 2-Point shots: total points on made 2-point shots
3. 3-Point shots: total points on made 3-point shots

This breakdown describes the style of a team and its strengths. Each category can be used to assess a team's offensive and defensive point distribution.

### Offensive Point Distribution

This section shares examples of a team's offensive distribution of points in these 3 categories.

#### Free Throws

`FT = FTM / TP * 100`

Pacific scored 24.3% of its points from the free throw line in the 2018-2019 season to rank 2nd amongst all Division-I teams.

Pacific scored 520 of its 2138 points from the foul line.

`FT = 520 / 2138 * 100 = 24.3`

Wofford was 332nd in the country gathering 14.6% of its points from the free throw line in the same season.

#### 2-Point Shots

`2P = 2P / TP * 100`

57.9% of Dayton's points came from 2-point shots in the 2018-2019 season. That's good for 6th amongst all Division-I teams.

Dayton made 697 2-point shots, good for 1394 points out of its 2406 total points.

`2P = 1394 / 2406 * 100 = 57.9%`

In contrast, the 2018-2019 Villanova team scored 38.0% of its points from 2-point shots. That's 352nd in the country in the same season.

#### 3-Point Shots

`3P = 3P / TP * 100`

Villanova scored 43.0% of its points from behind the 3-point line in the 2018-2019 season. This percentage was 8th amongst all teams.

The Wildcats made 380 3-points shots or scored 1,140 points of its 2,654 total points from 3-point land.

`3P = 1140 / 2654 * 100 = 42.95%`

Kentucky scored 23.0% of its points from the 3-point shot, good for 342nd in the country.

**Think of it as a pie, if a team is low in one area of point distribution \(small slice\), it will be high in another area \(big slice\).**

### Defensive Point Distribution

This section shares examples of a team's defensive distribution of points in these 3 categories.

#### Free Throws

`FT = Opp. FT / TP * 100`

Houston's opponents scored 23.3% of their points from the free throw line in the 2018-2019 season. This percentage was 13th in the nation.

The Cougar's opponents scored 527 of its 2258 points from the foul line.

`FT = 527 / 2258 * 100 = 23.3`

Notre Dame's opponents scored 13.6% of its points from the free throw line. This was 352nd amongst all Division-I teams.

Notre Dame didn't put its opponents on the foul line while Houston fouled its opponents early and often.

#### 2-Point Shots

`2P = 2P / TP * 100`

Michigan's opponents scored 59.5% of their points from 2-point shots in the 2018-2019 season. That's good for 2nd amongst all Division-I teams.

The Wolverines' opponents made 642 2-point shots, good for 1284 points out of their total 2158 points.

`2P = 1284 / 2158 * 100 = 59.5%`

As a comparison, Syracuse's opponents scored 40.2% of their points from 2-point shots. That's 350th in the country during the same year.

#### 3-Point Shots

`3P = 3P / TP * 100`

Virginia Tech allowed opponents to score 41.9% of their points from behind the 3-point line in the 2018-2019 season. This was good for 2nd highest in the country. 

If you recall, the Hokies allowed 49.9% of opponents shots from behind the 3-point line. If you allow more 3-point shots, it's likely your opponents will score a higher percentage from 3-point land too. 

The Hokies' opponents scored 909 of their 2172 total points from 3-point shots.

`3P = 909 / 2172 * 100 = 41.85%`

In contrast, Michigan allowed its opponents to score just 25.2% of their points from 3-point shots. That was 346th in the nation.
