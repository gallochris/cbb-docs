An individual player's ability to rebound increases its team's possessions. There are 2 percentages used to measure a player's ability to grab rebounds.

1. Offensive rebounding percentage \(OR%\)
2. Defensive rebounding percentage \(DR%\)

### Offensive Rebounding Percentage

What is the percentage of offensive rebounds a player gets?

This is calculated by incorporating a player's total offensive rebounds, percentage of minutes played, a team's total offensive rebounds, and opponent's defensive rebounds.

`OR% = PlayerOR / [%Min * (Team OR + Opp. DR)]`

For example, Ed Croswell of La Salle posted an offensive rebounding percentage of 18.1%.

This ranked 1st in the nation in the 2018-2019 season.

Croswell grabbed 98 offensive rebounds playing in 47.6% of his team's minutes. La Salle snagged 328 total offensive rebounds and their opponent's grabbed 812 total defensive rebounds.

`OR% = 98 / [.476 * (328 + 812)] = 0.1806 * 100`

### Defensive Rebounding Percentage

The same calculation is used to determine the percentage of defensive rebounds a player gets.

It incorporates a player's total defensive rebounds, percentage of minutes played, a team's total defensive rebounds, and an opponent's offensive rebounds.

`DR% = PlayerOR / [%Min * (Team DR + Opp. OR)]`

For example, Devontae Cacok of UNC Wilmington had a defensive rebounding percentage of 33.5%.

This ranked 1st amongst all Division-I players in the 2018-2019 season.

Cacok collected 273 defensive rebounds when he was on the court for 71% of his team's minutes. UNC Wilmington had 834 total defensive rebounds to their opponent's 293 offensive rebounds.

`OR% = 273 / [.710 * (834 + 293)] = 0.335 * 100`
