While a team's strength of schedule can give you an idea about how they stack up to competition, how do you know if a team has quality wins or losses?

Tiers can help answer this question.

[KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) defines 2 tiers:

1. **Tier A**: a game against a top-50 opponent adjusted for location of the game
2. **Tier B**: a game against a top-100 opponent adjusted for location of the game

### Why make adjustments for location?

Home court advantage exists in college basketball. [KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) gives a flat **3.75** points for the home team.

The **3.75** points was included in [KenPom's](http://kenpom.com/) announcement of using AdjEM for ratings prior to the 2016-17 season. It's explained at the [end of this blog post](http://kenpom.com/blog/ratings-methodology-update/).

For example, in the 2018-2019 season, Virginia would be expected to defeat the average Division-I team by about **34 points** on a neutral court.

If Virginia is playing host to the average Division-I team, its AdjEM jumps to about **+37**. This means at home, Virginia would be expected to defeat the average Division-I team by about 37 points.

This is why adjusting for location is important.

[KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) details this more in [this article](http://kenpom.com/blog/tiers-of-joy/) and shares this example:

_Beating the 90th-ranked team on the road is about as difficult as beating the 50th-best team on a neutral floor, which is roughly as difficult as beating the 20th-best team on oneâ€™s home floor._

[KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) does hint towards sharing site-specific home-court advantage values in the future too.

### Goodbye RPI, Hello NET 

Since 1981, the RPI \(Rating Percentage Index\) was used by the NCAA Selection Committee as one of the main factors in determining at-large selections for the NCAA Tournament. 

The NCAA replaced the RPI with the NET \(NCAA Evaluation Tool\) entering the 2018-19 season. Jordan Sperber does a great job breaking down improvements in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG_NpOEI8_Q).
