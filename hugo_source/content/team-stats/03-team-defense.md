A team's defense can be evaluated using the same 7 stats:

1. 3P%: opponent's 3-point field goal percentage
2. 2P%: opponent's 2-point field goal percentage
3. FT%: opponent's free throw percentage
4. Blk%: opponent's block percentage
5. St%: opponent's steal percentage
6. A%: opponent's assist percentage
7. 3PA%: opponent's 3-point attempt percentage

### 3P%

A team's defensive 3-point field goal percentage is its opponents' made 3-point shots divided by its opponents' attempted 3-point shots.

`3P% = Opp. 3PM / Opp. 3PA * 100`

Houston's defensive 3P% was 26.9% in the 2018-2019 season, good for 1st amongst all Division-I teams.

Its opponents made 233 3-point shots in 866 attempts.

`3P% = 233 / 866 * 100 = 26.9%`

For a comparison, Denver's opponents made 41.8% of their 3-point shots. That's good for 353rd in the country in the 2018-2019 season.

[KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) has [written extensively](http://kenpom.com/blog/3point-defense-should-not-be-defined-by-opponents-3p/) about _why_ a team's 3P% defense should not be defined by its opponent's 3P% offense.

### 2P%

A team's defensive 2-point field goal percentage is calculated by taking its opponents' 2-point makes and dividing them by its opponents' 2-point attempts.

`2P% = Opp. 2PM / Opp. 2PA * 100`

UC Irvine ranked 1st in the nation limiting opponents' 2P% to 40.5% in the 2018-19 season.

UC Irvine opponents made 568 of 1403 2-point shot attempts.

`2P% = 568 / 1403 * 100 = 40.5%`

For some contrast, Iowa's opponents made 53.5% of its 2-point shots. That clip was 299th amongst all Division-I teams.

While 3P% is not indicative of a team's 3-point defense, 2P% can be attributed some to how a team protects the rim and defends overall.

### FT%

A team's defensive free throw percentage is its opponent's free throw makes divided by its opponents' free throw attempts.

`FT% = FTM / FTA * 100`

UCF opponents made 65.0% of its free throws in the 2018-2019 season. This percentage put the Golden Knights at 3rd in the country.

And in comparison, North Dakota opponents made 78.6% of their free throw attempts. This was rated last or 353rd out of all teams in 2018-2019.

Obviously you can't defend free throws. It's an uncontested shot. But if you can limit a team from attempting free throws, it could be a big factor. Can't make them if you don't take them.

### Blk%

Defensive Block percentage is a team's total blocked shots divided by its opponents' 2-point field goal attempts.

`Blk% = Blocked shots / Opp. 2PA * 100`

Duke ranked 3rd in the country blocking 16.4% of its opponents' 2-point shot attempts.

The Blue Devils blocked 257 of its opponents' 1571 shot attempts.

`Blk = 257 / 1571 * 100 = 16.4%`

Northeastern blocked only 6.0% of its opponents' shots in 2018-2019. This clip ranked 322nd in the country.

### Stl%

A team's defensive steals percentage is a team's total number of steals divided by its opponent's offensive possessions.

`Stls% = Total steals / Possessions`

Washington posted a 13.3% steals percentage in 2018-2019. This was good for 1st in the country.

The Huskies recorded 323 steals in its opponents' estimated 2,430 offensive possessions.

`Stls% = 294 / 2,430 * 100 = 13.3%`

In comparison, Winthrop's defensive steal percentage was more than half of that at 5.4%. This ranked last in the country.

### A%

A team's defensive assist percentage is its opponents' total amount of assists divided by its opponents' made field goals. This includes both 3-point and 2-point makes.

`A% = Opp. assists / Opp. FGM * 100`

New Mexico State ranked 1st amongst all Division-I teams limiting its opponents to a 39.2% assist percentage. New Mexico State's opponents had 309 assists on 789 made baskets.

`A% = 309 / 789 * 100 = 39.2%`

Syracuse opponents registered a 67.8% assist percentage in the 2018-2019 season. This was almost dead last \(352nd\) amongst all teams.

_Assist percentage sometimes has less do with defense, and more to do with style of play. Syracuse is known for its 2-3 zone, and to beat a zone, you must share the ball._

### 3PA%

A team's defensive 3-point attempt percentage is the percentage of 3-point shots its opponents attempt divided by their opponents' total shot attempts.

`3PA% = Opp. 3PA / Opp. FGA * 100`

Stanford's opponents took 27.3% of their shots from behind the 3-point line in the 2018-2019 season. This was 1st amongst all Division-I teams.

The Cardinals opponents' attempted 515 3-pointers out of 1,886 total shot attempts.

`3PA% = 515 / 1886 * 100 = 27.3%`

In contrast, Virginia Tech's opponents attempted 49.9% of their shots from behind the 3-point line. That's percentage ranked 352nd in the country.

**Remember**: Teams have much more control over how many 3-point shots their opponents shoot than how many they make.
