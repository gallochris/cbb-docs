      <description>A team&amp;rsquo;s success comes down to its efficiency.
When a team has the ball, how easily does it score points?
When a team&amp;rsquo;s opponent has the ball, how easily does their opponent score points?
Efficiency answers both these questions.
In this section, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover the different types of efficiency and how it&amp;rsquo;s measured.

      <description>Possessions are the foundation of a team&amp;rsquo;s offensive and defensive efficiency.
A team can&amp;rsquo;t score if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the ball.
Basketball has evolved over time all because of possessions.
Dean Smith ran the 4 Corner Offense to stall the game. In the 1982 ACC Championship game, North Carolina held the ball for almost 7 minutes in the second half and beat Virginia 47-45.
By 1985, the NCAA adopted a shot clock to end this strategy.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s start with Offensive Efficiency.
A team&amp;rsquo;s offensive efficiency is the amount of points it scores per 100 offensive possessions.
OE = (Points scored * 100) / Possessions
An Example
Let&amp;rsquo;s stick with the 2019 Championship Game between Virginia and Texas Tech.
Virginia had around 69.93 possessions and scored 85 points. Its offensive efficiency was around 121.6.
OE = (85 * 100) / 69.93 = 121.55
Texas Tech scored 77 points over 70.</description>

      <description>Combined efficiency is the number of points a team would gain or lose in 100 possessions. Take a team&amp;rsquo;s offensive efficiency and subtract the defensive efficiency.
Combined Efficiency = OE - DE
An Example
Using the same example of the 2018 Championshp Game between Virginia and Texas Tech, Virginia&amp;rsquo;s offensive efficiency was 121 and its defensive efficiency was 109.
The Cavaliers combined efficiency is 12.
Combined Efficiency = 121 - 109 = 8</description>

      <description>Tempo or pace is the number of possessions a team uses in a game.
Remember the 4 Corner offense? Dean Smith preferred to play a slower tempo to limit their opponents&amp;rsquo; possessions.
Today, there is a shot clock, and the 4 Corner offense likely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be as effective.
Why is tempo or pace important? Not all teams have the same preferences. Some teams like to play fast or up-tempo. Other teams want to slow the game down.</description>

      <description>Offensive and defensive efficiency come directly from a box score. The four factors lead to the amount of points a team scores and how they choose to play contributes to the amount of possessions a team uses.
It&amp;rsquo;s raw information. The raw offensive efficiency and raw defensive efficiency don&amp;rsquo;t factor in competition.
Why is this important? Here are 2 additional examples of the importance of adjusted efficiencies using KenPom&amp;rsquo;s analysis.</description>

      <description>Tempo or pace shows how a team prefers to play. A team&amp;rsquo;s style.
Do they play up-tempo? Do they like to slow it down? Do they play man-to-man defense? Or zone?
A lot of these questions can be answered calculating a team&amp;rsquo;s average possession length.
Average possession length is a closer look at a team&amp;rsquo;s pace. It&amp;rsquo;s a new metric, and KenPom introduces it in this article.
APL = a team&#39;s seconds on offense and defense</description>
