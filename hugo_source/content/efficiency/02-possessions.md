Possessions are the foundation of a team's offensive and defensive efficiency.

A team can't score if it doesn't have the ball.

Basketball has evolved over time all because of possessions.

Dean Smith ran the [4 Corner Offense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtyyNd5Eoow) to stall the game. In the 1982 ACC Championship game, North Carolina held the ball for almost 7 minutes in the second half and beat Virginia 47-45.

By 1985, the NCAA adopted a shot clock to end this strategy. And in 2015-2016 season, the NCAA reduced the shot clock to 30 seconds.

These rule changes increase the amount of possessions per game.

### Possessions are an estimated guess

Possessions is not an official NCAA statistic. It _must be estimated_.

_Why?_

In a perfect world, possessions would be defined by an action on a box score. A possession ends in any of the following situations:

1. A shot is made
2. A shot is missed and rebounded by the defense or offense
3. A free throw is made
4. A free throw is missed and rebounded by the defense or offense
5. The offense turns the ball over
6. The game or half ends

This isn't always what happens or how a team gains a possession.

In large part, it's because of _fouls and free throws_.

For example, teams are awarded 1-and-1 free throws after their opponent commits 7 team fouls. If the first free throw is made, a second one is awarded.

If a player is fouled shooting a 2-point shot, the player gets 2 free throws. A player can also be fouled when shooting a 3-point shot, meaning 3 free throws are awarded.

A player can be fouled on a made shot, and earn an extra free throw. Known as an _and-1_.

These variables mean possessions must be estimated because you can't always know how a team gets to the foul line.

### How is possessions calculated?

Possessions have 4 main ingredients:

1. Field goal attempts \(amount of total shots a team takes\)
2. Amount of offensive rebounds
3. Turnovers
4. Free throw attempts

`Possessions = (FGA - OR )+ TO + (.475 * FTA)`

_The free throw multiplier_ is required because it's difficult to determine how a team made it to the foul line.

A team awarded 2 foul shots accounts for 1 possession. If it a team is awarded a foul shot after a made basket or gets an _and-1_, the single foul shot doesn't result in a new possession. The made shot is the only possession.

[KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) uses the .475 multiplier. The **.475 multiplier estimates** how many free throw attempts equal 1 possession. The key here is it's slightly less than one-half. This figure comes from play-by-play data.

Others have used .44, .40, or .42 as the multiplier in the past. The difference between these and .475 comes to about a 1% change in the efficiency calculations.

Possessions are counted for both teams and averaged.

#### Example

Let's take at the 2019 National Championship Game between Virginia and Texas Tech.

Virginia attempted 59 shots, recorded 11 offensive rebounds, 11 turnovers, and attempted 23 free throws. This results in 69.93 possessions.


`Possessions = (59 - 11) + 11 + (.475 * 23) = 69.93`

Texas Tech attempted 66 shots, grabbed 9 offensive rebounds, turned the ball over 8 times, and attempted 15 free throws. That's 78.30 possessions.

`Possessions = (66 - 9) + 8 + (.475 * 15) = 70.63`

The average of these two numbers is 70.28.

The game had around **70 total possessions** \(Virginia won 85-77 in overtime\).

This is the foundation that is used to manage how efficient each team was in the game.
