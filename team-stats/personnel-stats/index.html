            <h2>Personnel Stats</h2>
            

<p>A team&rsquo;s personnel can be measured across 5 different categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Height</strong>: total height of a team weighted by minutes played</li>
<li><strong>Bench Minutes</strong>: the number of minutes a team&rsquo;s bench plays</li>
<li><strong>Continuity</strong>: minutes played season-to-season</li>
<li><strong>Experience</strong>: year in school weighted by minutes played</li>
<li><strong>Defensive Fingerprint</strong>: identifies the style of a team&rsquo;s defense</li>
<li><strong>2-Foul Participation</strong>: percentage of time a starter with 2 fouls plays in the first half</li>
</ol>

<p>Assumptions are made for each of these components, and detailed explanations are below.</p>

<h3 id="height">Height</h3>

<p><a href="http://kenpom.com/">KenPom</a> calls height is the <a href="http://www.basketballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=82">most talked about physical trait</a> in basketball. You can&rsquo;t teach it, right?</p>

<p>It does have a slight correlation to a team&rsquo;s offensive and defensive efficiency. And it makes sense, a taller team might defend well and score at ease in the paint versus a shorter team. But it&rsquo;s not the <em>only metric</em> that matters.</p>

<p><strong>Average Height</strong></p>

<p>This is measured by gathering the average listed height of every player on a team, weighted by the minutes played.</p>

<p>It <em>excludes players that play less than 10% of their team&rsquo;s minutes</em>.</p>

<p>Syracuse led the country in average height at 80.1 inches in the 2017-2018 season.</p>

<p>The shortest player featured in over 10% of the team&rsquo;s minutes was 6&rsquo;5 or 75 inches.</p>

<p><strong>Positional Height</strong></p>

<p>This can also be broken down into positional height, meaning by each of the 5 positions on the court.</p>

<p>It takes the minutes played for each team ordered by height. For example, 20% of minutes played by the tallest players are likely the center&rsquo;s minutes.</p>

<p>For example, Purdue&rsquo;s average height at the center position was +5.4 inches taller than the average of all teams.</p>

<p>Purdue&rsquo;s starting center, Isaac Haas, was 7&rsquo;2 or 86 inches, and their backup center, Matt Haarms was 7&rsquo;3 or 87 inches.</p>

<p><strong>Effective Height</strong></p>

<p>Effective height is the average of the center and power forward position. The same Purdue squad posted an effective height of 3 inches for these 2 positions.</p>

<h3 id="bench-minutes">Bench Minutes</h3>

<p>Bench minutes, defined by <a href="http://kenpom.com/">KenPom</a>, makes an assumption that the starters of a team are the 5 players that have played the most minutes on the year.</p>

<p>The remaining minutes are assumed to be the bench minutes. If a player has played less than <em>10% of their team&rsquo;s minutes, the player is excluded</em> in the bench minutes.</p>

<p>Alabama&rsquo;s bench played in 36.6% of its minutes in the 2017-2018. That ranked 49th in the country. In 3 of its 5 positions, players shared a large percentage of minutes played.</p>

<p>In contrast, Kansas&rsquo; bench played in only 20.9% of its minutes. That&rsquo;s 345th amongst all Division-I teams.</p>

<p>Whether a team relies on its bench is more of an attribute than a driving factor of its success. It can certainly be a factor if there is foul trouble, injuries, or a stretch of several games played in a short period.</p>

<h3 id="continuity">Continuity</h3>

<p>Continuity is the percentage of a team’s minutes that are played by the same player or players from last season to this season.</p>

<p>It answers more than are the same players playing this season?</p>

<p>It uses a percentage of a players minutes played because of injuries and a player&rsquo;s increased or decreased minutes season to season.</p>

<p><a href="http://kenpom.com/">KenPom</a> takes each player on the current roster, uses the minimum minutes (on a percentage basis) he played comparing this season and last season, and then takes the sum for all players.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s use the 2015-16 North Carolina team as an example. Below are the minutes from the 2014-2015 season to the 2015-2016 team. The far column includes the minimum value.</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">Player  |   %Min 14-15  | %Min 15-16  | Min
--------+---------------+-------------+-----+
Paige   |    16.5       |   13.4      | 13.4
Johnson |    12.2       |   14.0      | 12.2
Jackson |    13.3       |   14.1      | 13.3
Hicks   |    7.35       |   9.00      | 7.35
Meeks   |    11.2       |   8.48      | 8.48
Berry   |    5.20       |   15.4      | 5.20
Pinson  |    3.92       |   9.33      | 3.92
Britt   |    7.60       |   7.50      | 7.50
James   |    4.99       |   3.61      | 3.61
Maye    |    0.00       |   2.22      | 0.00
Williams|    0.00       |   1.52      | 0.00
White   |    0.30       |   0.40      | 0.30
Coleman |    0.24       |   0.21      | 0.21
Coker   |    0.00       |   0.20      | 0.00
Dalton  |    0.03       |   0.20      | 0.03
Egbuna  |    0.00       |   0.24      | 0.00
--------+---------------+-------------+-----+
</code></pre>

<p>The sum of the last column is <strong>75.5</strong>. North Carolina players played around 76% of the minutes from 2014-2015 to 2015-2016 season. That was good for 12th amongst all Division-I teams in the 2015-16 season.</p>

<p>Continuity is a new, and fascinating, stat. It tells more of a story, and as <a href="http://kenpom.com/">KenPom</a> describes teams with <a href="http://kenpom.com/blog/measuring-continuity/">better continuity</a>, tend to perform better too.</p>

<p>In a landscape where the best teams often feature players headed to the NBA after one year, continuity is a fun metric to follow.</p>

<p>For example, below is Kentucky&rsquo;s continuity over the last 5 seasons:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">Year    |   Continuity  | Division-I Rank |
--------+---------------+----------------+
17-18   |   11.2        |   348
16-17   |   30.2        |   322
15-16   |   22.0        |   335
14-15   |   49.6        |   176
13-14   |   23.6        |   336
--------+---------------+----------------+
</code></pre>

<p>Kentucky continuity is often low, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re not winning games.</p>

<h3 id="experience">Experience</h3>

<p>Experience is another storytelling stat. <a href="http://kenpom.com/">KenPom</a> makes the assumption that a player&rsquo;s eligibility class determines their experience.</p>

<p>Under this assumption, the following class has these levels of experience:</p>

<pre><code class="language-text">Year       | Experience |
-----------+------------+
Freshmen   |   0        |
Sophomore  |   1        |
Junior     |   2        |
Senior     |   3        |
-----------+------------+
</code></pre>

<p>Experience uses minutes played similar to the average height calculation. Players that play in <em>less than 10% of their team&rsquo;s minutes are excluded</em>.</p>

<p>In the 2017-2018 season, Wichita State ranked 13th in the country with 2.36 years of experience. This squad featured 9 upperclassmen (seniors and/or juniors).</p>

<p>For a comparison, Kentucky ranked dead last in the country with 0.18 years of experience.</p>

<h3 id="defensive-fingerprint">Defensive Fingerprint</h3>

<p>Does a team play man-to-man? Zone? Both?</p>

<p>The answer can be found in a team&rsquo;s defensive fingerprint. <a href="http://kenpom.com/">KenPom</a> uses a variety of stats to breakdown teams into 4 defensive categories:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Mostly man</strong>: team plays mostly man-to-man defense</li>
<li><strong>Inconclusive</strong>: can&rsquo;t identify a specific defensive tendency</li>
<li><strong>Some zone</strong>: team is in zone defense for a good amount of its defensive possessions</li>
<li><strong>Mostly zone</strong>: team plays most its defensive possessions in a zone defense</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="http://kenpom.com/">KenPom</a> describes defensive fingerprint as raw. It uses assist percentage, 3-point attempt percentage, free throw attempt percentage, turnover percentage, and defensive rebounding percentage.</p>

<p>It weights these stats to develop a profile, and place a team in a certain fingerprint category. For example, zone teams tend to have higher a defensive assist percentage and 3-point attempt percentage.</p>

<p>Syracuse is known for its 2-3 zone. It statistically is near the bottom of all teams in defensive assist percentage and 3-point attempt percentage.</p>

<p>In the 2017-2018 season, Syracuse ranked 351th in defensive A% at 73.8 and 338th in defensive 3PA% at a 44.5% clip.</p>

<h3 id="2-foul-participation">2-Foul Participation</h3>

<p>When a player picks up his second foul in the first half, does he head to the bench?</p>

<p>2-foul participation attempt to answer this question and reveal more of a coaching philosophy around fouls. The measurement is the percentage of time that a starter with 2 fouls in the first half has been allowed to play as detailed in <a href="https://kenpom.com/blog/introducing-2-foul-participation/">this blog post</a>.</p>

<p>For example, starters for Virginia played 3.8% of minutes with 2 fouls in the first half in the 2017-18 season. Virginia, and coach Tony Bennett, ranked 331st in the country in this metric.</p>

<p>{% hint style=&ldquo;info&rdquo; %}
<em>Remember when Virginia lost to 16-seed UMBC in the NCAA Tournament?</em> Both Isaiah Wilkins and Devon Hall <a href="https://virginiasports.com/boxscore.aspx?id=3540&amp;path=mbball">picked up 2 fouls</a> in the first half, and both exited the game for the remainder of the first half after doing so.
{% endhint %}</p>

<p>KenPom also includes a few other measurements:</p>

<ul>
<li>total amount of time starters have 2 fouls</li>
<li>total time starters with 2 fouls are on the floor</li>
<li>adjusted 2-foul participation: accounts for backcourt players being allowed to play more</li>
<li>percentage of bench minutes</li>
</ul>
