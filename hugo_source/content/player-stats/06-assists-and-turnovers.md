An individual player's ability to distribute the ball and avoid turnovers is measured by 2 stats.

1. Assist Rate
2. Turnover Rate

### Assist Rate

A player's assist rate is computed by taking a player's total assists divided by the made field goals by the player's teammates while the player is on the court.

Here is the calculation:

`ARate = 100 * AST / (((MP / (Team's MP / 5)) * Team's FG) - FG)`

For example, Murray State's Ja Morant posted an assist rate of 51.9 in the 2018-2019 season. This was good for 1st in the country.

Morant had 331 assists in 1207 minutes played compared to his team's 1290 total minutes. Murray State made 988 field goals to Morant's 265 field goals.


### Turnover Rate

Turnover rate is the percentage of a player's possessions used on turnovers. It's complicated to measure and explain for individual players.

Remember when assessing a team's turnover rate, you take the percentage of possessions that end in a turnover.

For an individual player, turnover rate uses _personal possessions_. This means context is important. Players that don't handle the ball often or at all will have a deflated turnover rate. A guard who constantly has the ball will likely have a higher turnover rate.

For example, Florida's Noah Locke posted a 5.1 turnover rate in 2018-2019. This was rated 2nd amongst all Division-I players.

Around 5 percent of Locke's personal possessions ended in a turnover.
