This stat measures a team's ability to shoot 2-point and 3-point shots.

A teamâ€™s field goal percentage is calculated by the number of shots made divided by the number of shots attempted. This includes **both** 2-point and 3-point shots.

`FG% = FGM/FGA * 100`

For example, Virginia defeated Syracuse during the 2018-19 regular season by a score of 79-53. The Cavaliers made 28 shots and attempted 51 total shots. 

Virginia's field goal percentage was **54.9**%.

`FG% = 28/51 = 0.549 * 100`

Effective field goal percentage takes into account that a 3-point field goal is worth more than a 2-point field goal.

`eFG% = (.5 * 3FGM + FGM) / FGA * 100`

Virginia made 18 3-point shots and attempted 25 in the game. 18 of their 28 made shots were worth 3 points. And 26 of their 51 shot attempts were 3-pointers.

Virginia's eFG% was **72.5%** for the game.

`(eFG% = (.5 * 18 + 28) / 51 = 0.7255 * 100)`

### Why this statistic is important

Effective field goal percentage indicates how easily a team scores most of its points. A higher percentage shows a team is efficient at shooting and likely has a chance to win many games.

A team's ability to defend or lower their opponent's eFG% is equally important. If a team can hold their opponent to a lower eFG%, the better chance it has to win.
