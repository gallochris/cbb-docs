Let's start with **Offensive Efficiency**.

A team's offensive efficiency is the amount of points it scores per 100 offensive possessions.

`OE = (Points scored * 100) / Possessions`

**An Example**

Let's stick with the 2019 Championship Game between Virginia and Texas Tech.

Virginia had around 69.93 possessions and scored 85 points. Its offensive efficiency was **around 121.6**.

`OE = (85 * 100) / 69.93 = 121.55`

Texas Tech scored 77 points over 70.63 possessions for an OE of **around 109**.

`OE = (77 * 100) / 70.63 = 109.02`

### Defensive Efficiency

A team's defensive efficiency is the amount of points it allows per 100 defensive possessions.

`DE = (Points allowed * 100) / Possessions`

**An Example**

Following our example above, Virgina's defensive efficiency is **around 109**. Virginia allowed 77 points over 70.63 possessions.

`DE = (77 * 100) / 70.63 = 109.02`

Texas Tech's defensive efficiency is **around 121.6**. The Red Raiders allowed 85 points over 69.93 possessions.

`DE = (85 * 100) / 69.93 = 121.55`

Notice this is the _inverse_. An opponent's offensive efficiency equals a team's defensive efficiency. A team's offensive efficiency equals their opponent's defensive efficiency.

### Why are these numbers so high?

Remember this is the number of points scored or allowed per **100 possessions**. Offensive efficiency _isn't_ an indication of how many points a team scores. Defensive efficiency _doesn't_ suggest how many points a team allows.

The final score of this game was Virginia 85, Texas Tech 77. Not 121-109.

In our example above, the game featured about 70 possessions.

The Offensive Efficiency numbers are high because the statistic is over 100 possessions. Not 72 or 70.

_Don't confuse points-per-game with offensive or defensive efficiency._

### Why was a team efficient on offense or defense?

A team's efficiency can be broken into four factors. Remember those [factors](/four-factors/intro)?

Let's continue with this same game as an example.

Virginia turned in an offensive efficiency of around 121.

`eFG% = 55.1%`
<br>
`OR% = 32.4%`
<br>
`TO% = 15.8%`
<br>
`FTRate = 39.0`

Virginia made a solid percentage of its shots, avoided turnovers around 85% of the time, and frequently got to the foul line.

Texas Tech posted an offensive efficiency of 109.

`eFG% = 50.8%`
<br>
`OR% = 24.3%`
<br>
`TO% = 11.5%`
<br>
`FTRate = 23.8`

While Texas Tech avoided turnovers on almost 89% of its possessions, the Red Raiders rebounded fewer missed shots and got to the foul line less than Virginia. Texas Tech also made a lower percentage of its shots. 

This a good reason why Virginia won the game by 8 points. The Cavaliers were more efficient on both ends.
