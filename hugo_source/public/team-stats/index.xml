And what match-up is worth watching or tuning in to?
In this section, we&amp;rsquo;ll answer each one of these questions.

      <description>How a team gets its points can be broken down into 3 areas:
 Free throws: total points on made free throws 2-Point shots: total points on made 2-point shots 3-Point shots: total points on made 3-point shots  This breakdown describes the style of a team and its strengths. Each category can be used to assess a team&amp;rsquo;s offensive and defensive point distribution.
Offensive Point Distribution This section shares examples of a team&amp;rsquo;s offensive distribution of points in these 3 categories.</description>
