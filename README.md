# CBB Docs
This is the master branch for college basketball stats help site: [cbbstatshelp.com](https://cbbstatshelp.com/). 

The content lives in the `hugo_source` branch and it's hosted in the `gh-pages` branch. 

It uses the [Hugo documentation theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/dot-hugo-documentation-theme/).
