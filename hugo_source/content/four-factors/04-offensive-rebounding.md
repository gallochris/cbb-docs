A team's ability to increase its number of possessions, gives it a greater chance to score points and win games. Offensive rebounding is a main factor for a team to gain possessions.

This is measured by offensive rebounding percentage or the percentage of offensive rebounds a team grabs over the course of a game or season.

`OR% = Offensive Rebounds / (Offensive Rebounds + Opponent's Defensive Rebounds)`

For example, over the entire 2018-2019 season Baylor's Offensive Rebounding Percentage was **37.3%**.

The Bears grabbed 446 offensive rebounds to their opponents 748 defensive rebounds.

`OR% = 446 / (446 + 748) = 0.373 * 100`

This means on a Baylor missed shot or free throw, the team rebounded the ball **around 37%** of the time.

### Defensive Rebounding & Made Shots

Similar to how a team forces turnovers, defensive rebounding can limit a team's chance to earn more possessions.

For example, Baylor posted a defensive rebounding rate of **28.8%**. The Bears pulled down 835 defensive rebounds and its opponents snagged 338 offensive rebounds.

Opponents' OR% = 338 / \(338 + 835\) = .2882 \* 100\)

This means Baylor's opponents only grabbed an offensive rebound on **about 29%** of its misses.

### Team Rebounds

Rebounds are measured differently across all of college basketball. [KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) and other analytics sites compute percentages that **don't include team rebounds**.

Team rebounds are totaled by specific schools and other entities. This means there can be a slight difference between rebounding totals depending on the source of the box score or statistics.

_What is a team rebound?_

If a team misses a shot, a rebound is recorded. Not every missed shot falls into the possession of an individual player.

For example, a missed shot can go out of bounds. In this situation, a team rebound is given to the team that was defending the missed shot.

This is common if a team shoots an airball, a missed shot goes over the backboard, or 2 or more players from the same team gain possession of the ball.
