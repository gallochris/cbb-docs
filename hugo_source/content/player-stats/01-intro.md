The same way [KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) rates teams, players can also be evaluated.

In this section, you'll find the different stats that go into assessing an individual player.

* [Minutes played and possessions used](/player-stats/minutes-played)
* [Offensive rating \(ORtg\)](/player-stats/offensive-ratings)
* [Shooting \(%Shots, eFG%, & TS%\)](/player-stats/shooting)
* [Rebounding percentages \(OR% & DR%\)](/player-stats/rebounding)
* [Assists and Turnovers](/player-stats/assists-and-turnovers)
* [Blocks & Steals](/player-stats/blocks-and-steals)
