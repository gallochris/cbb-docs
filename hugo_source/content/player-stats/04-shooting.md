We'll look at 3 calculations here to measure a player's ability to shoot:

1. %Shots
2. eFG%
3. TS%

### Percentage of shots taken

When a player is on the court, how many shots does the player attempt compared the rest of the team?

A percentage of shots taken is measured by taking a players' field goal attempts divided by its percentage of minutes played multiplied by its team's field goal attempts.

`%Shots = Player's FGA / (%Min * TeamFGA)`

For example, Duke's RJ Barrett took 33% of his team's shots in 2018-2019 season. This ranked 21st amongst all Division-I players.

Barrett attempted 702 of his team's 2418 shots and played in 87.9% minutes over the year.

`%Shots = 702 / (.879 x 2418) = 33.03`

A percentage of shots a player has taken is a good indication of possessions used.

### Effective Field Goal Percentage

The exact calculation used for teams here is also applied to individuals. As a reminder, effective field goal percentage accounts for the fact that a 3-point field goal is worth more than a two-point field goal.

`eFG% = (.5 * 3FGM + FGM) / FGA`

For example, Brandon Clarke of Gonzaga had an eFG% was 69.2% in the 2018-2019 season. This was 4th in the country.

Only 4 of Clarke's 257 made field goals were from behind 3-point line, and he attempted 374 total shots.

`eFG% = (.5 * 4 + 253) / 374 = 0.6818 * 100`

### True Shooting Percentage

True shooting percentage is used to more accurately define a player's ability to shoot. It incorporates field goal percentage, field goal attempts, and free throw attempts.

It uses the same multiplier \(.475\) that is used when calculating efficiency. The multiplier estimates how many free throw attempts equal one possession.

`TS% = Points scored / ( 2* (FGA + 0.475 * FTA) )`

For example, Princeton's Richmond Aririguzoh posted a true shooting percentage of 72.3% in the 2018-2019 season. This is good for 1st in the country.

Aririguzoh scored 317 points, attempted 165 field goals and 114 free throws.

`TS% = 317 / (2 * (165 + 0.475 * 114) ) = 0.723 * 100`
