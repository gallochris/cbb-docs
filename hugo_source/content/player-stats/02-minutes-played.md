Minutes played measures how often a player is on the floor per game. This stat doesn't factor in overtime games, so it can be a bit misleading.

[KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) uses a percentage of possible minutes played to account for overtime periods.

`(%Min) = Minutes played / Possible Amount of Minutes`

In the 2018-2019 season, Ky Bowman of Boston College played in 96.8% of all minutes. This was good for 1st in the country.

Battle played 1220 total minutes of a possible 1260 minutes.

`%Min = 1200 / 1220 = 0.9683 x 100`

**How does this compare to minutes per game?**

Boston College played in 31 games in 2018-2019. Bowman played a total of 39.4 minutes per game.

96.8% of 40 minutes is roughly 38.7 minutes per game.

**Why is the percentage of minutes slightly higher?**

Because Boston College played 4 overtime games. These games added 20 minutes to the possible minutes Bowman could have played.

**What about injuries?**

This stat doesn't factor in injuries. It's impossible to predict and measure an injury. The total number of games played by the individual can give a better idea of how those minutes are spread out.

### Possessions Used

When a player is on the court, how involved is the player on the offensive end of the court?

The answer is a player's percentage of possessions used \(%Poss\). It's calculated by giving credit or blame to a player when their actions end a possession.

A few different ways a possession can end:

- making a shot \(credit\)
- missing a shot, rebounded by defense \(blame\)
- committing a turnover \(blame\)

`(%Poss) = Possessions Ended / Total Possessions`

Following the same example, Bowman was used on 26.7% of Boston College possessions in the 2018-2019 season.
