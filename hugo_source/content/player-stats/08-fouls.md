There are 3 metrics that indicate how fouls factor into an individual's effectiveness:

1. Free Throw Rate \(FTRate\)
2. Fouls committed per 40 minutes played \(FC/40\)
3. Fouls drawn per 40 minutes played \(FD/40\)

### Free Throw Rate \(FTRate\)

Free throw rate measures a player's ability to get to the foul line relative to how often he attempts to score. It takes a players free throw attempts and divides those attempts by the player's total field goal attempts.

`FTRate = 100 * FTA / FGA`

For example, Steffon Mitchell of Boston College had a free throw rate was 147.9 in the 2018-2019 season. This ranked 1st amongst all Division-I players.

Mitchell attempted 108 free throws and 73 field goals.

`FTRate = 100 * 108 / 73 = 147.9`

### Fouls committed per 40 minutes played FC/40

This is a straight-forward stat that shows the amount of fouls a player commits per 40 minutes played.

`FC/40 = (Fouls committed / MP) * 40`

For example, Kyle Guy of Virginia committed 1.16 fouls per 40 minutes in 2018-2019. This was 5th in the country.

Snider committed 39 fouls playing in 1345 minutes over the season.

`FC/40 = (39 / 1345) * 40 = 1.16`

### Fouls drawn per 40 minutes played \(FD/40\)

This is a stat developed by [KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) and explained more on [this page](http://kenpom.com/blog/help-with-team-page/). It makes several assumptions from Division-I averages, [KenPom](http://kenpom.com/) details below:

* each shooting foul results in an average of 1.8 free throws
* 16.3% of all fouls are committed by the offense
* no offensive foul results in a shot \(this is not entirely true since some offensive fouls occur in rebounding situations\)
* players on defense draw fouls at equal rates
* players on offense draw non-shooting fouls proportional to their percentage of possessions used

Applying all of these assumptions can give a fair estimate of a player's fouls drawn.

For example, Deishuan Booker of Long Beach State drew 7.6 fouls per 40 minutes played in 2018-2019. This ranked 1st in the nation.

Booker played in 1060 minutes in the 2018-2019 season drawing about 200 fouls.

`FD/40 = (200 / 987) * 40 = 7.6`
