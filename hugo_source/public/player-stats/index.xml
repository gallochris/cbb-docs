      <description>The same way KenPom rates teams, players can also be evaluated.
In this section, you&amp;rsquo;ll find the different stats that go into assessing an individual player.
 Minutes played and possessions used Offensive rating (ORtg) Shooting (%Shots, eFG%, &amp;amp; TS%) Rebounding percentages (OR% &amp;amp; DR%) Assists and Turnovers Blocks &amp;amp; Steals Fouls  </description>

      <description>Minutes played measures how often a player is on the floor per game. This stat doesn&amp;rsquo;t factor in overtime games, so it can be a bit misleading.
KenPom uses a percentage of possible minutes played to account for overtime periods.
(%Min) = Minutes played / Possible Amount of Minutes
In the 2017-2018 season, Tyus Battle of Syracuse played in 96.2% of all minutes. This was good for 1st in the country.</description>

      <description>Remember a team&amp;rsquo;s offensive efficiency?
An individual player can be assessed using a similar measurement. This is a player&amp;rsquo;s Offensive Rating (ORtg).
This stat comes from the mind of Dean Oliver. Oliver defines the offensive rating:
Individual offensive rating is the number of points produced by a player per hundred total individual possessions.
This number tells you how many points a player is likely to score when given an opportunity.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ll look at 3 calculations here to measure a player&amp;rsquo;s ability to shoot:
 %Shots eFG% TS%  Percentage of shots taken When a player is on the court, how many shots does the player attempt compared the rest of the team?
A percentage of shots taken is measured by taking a players&amp;rsquo; field goal attempts divided by its percentage of minutes played multiplied by its team&amp;rsquo;s field goal attempts.</description>

      <description>An individual player&amp;rsquo;s ability to rebound increases its team&amp;rsquo;s possessions. There are 2 percentages used to measure a player&amp;rsquo;s ability to grab rebounds.
 Offensive rebounding percentage (OR%) Defensive rebounding percentage (DR%)  Offensive Rebounding Percentage What is the percentage of offensive rebounds a player gets?
This is calculated by incorporating a player&amp;rsquo;s total offensive rebounds, percentage of minutes played, a team&amp;rsquo;s total offensive rebounds, and opponent&amp;rsquo;s defensive rebounds.</description>

      <description>An individual player&amp;rsquo;s ability to distribute the ball and avoid turnovers is measured by 2 stats.
 Assist Rate Turnover Rate  Assist Rate A player&amp;rsquo;s assist rate is computed by taking a player&amp;rsquo;s total assists divided by the made field goals by the player&amp;rsquo;s teammates while the player is on the court.
Here is the calculation:
ARate = 100 * AST / (((MP / (Team&#39;s MP / 5)) * Team&#39;s FG) - FG)</description>

      <description>A player&amp;rsquo;s defensive ability can be measured using blocks and steals.
 Block Percentage (%Blocks) Steal Percentage (%Stls)  Block Percentage Block percentage is the percentage of opponents&amp;rsquo; 2-point shots that are blocked by an individual player while he&amp;rsquo;s on the floor.
%Blocks = Total Player&#39;s Blocks / (%Min * Opponents&#39; 2-point attempts)
For example, Sagaba Konate of West Virginia posted a 15.64 block percentage in the 2017-2018 season. A block percentage of 15.</description>

      <description>There are 3 metrics that indicate how fouls factor into an individual&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness:
 Free Throw Rate (FTRate) Fouls committed per 40 minutes played (FC/40) Fouls drawn per 40 minutes played (FD/40)  Free Throw Rate (FTRate) Free throw rate measures a player&amp;rsquo;s ability to get to the foul line relative to how often he attempts to score. It takes a players free throw attempts and divides those attempts by the player&amp;rsquo;s total field goal attempts.</description>
