Combined efficiency is the number of points a team would gain or lose in 100 possessions. Take a team's offensive efficiency and subtract the defensive efficiency.

`Combined Efficiency = OE - DE`

**An Example**

Using the same example of the 2018 Championshp Game between Virginia and Texas Tech, Virginia's offensive efficiency was 121 and its defensive efficiency was 109.

The Cavaliers combined efficiency is **12**.

`Combined Efficiency = 121 - 109 = 8`

This gives a team 1 efficiency number instead of 2. It can be described as a glorified margin of victory.

Virginia's combined efficiency is 12. It won the game by 8 points.

_Remember the game didn't feature 100 possessions. Combined efficiency accounts for 100 possessions. If it did, this suggests Virginia would have won by 12 points._

### Why this statistic is misleading

Offensive and defensive efficiency tell you how effective a team is based on the [four factors](/four-factors/intro). Combined efficiency leaves a lot unknowns as to why a team is good or bad.

If all you're given is a combined efficiency of 12, it's hard to know if a team is good offensively or defensively, and what factors are leading to that success.
